# PhantomGuard AI  
AI-Based Phantom Energy Drain Detection & Sustainability Optimization System

## Overview

PhantomGuard AI is an intelligent energy optimization system designed to detect hidden energy waste across campus infrastructure. While most institutions monitor electricity consumption, they lack intelligent systems that interpret usage patterns to identify idle equipment, inefficient cooling, and phantom standby loads.

This solution transforms raw energy data into actionable sustainability insights.

## Problem Statement

Campuses experience significant hidden energy waste due to undetected operational inefficiencies such as idle laboratory equipment, overcooling systems, and unmanaged standby power consumption. Traditional monitoring systems provide raw data but fail to detect abnormal usage patterns or offer corrective guidance.

---

## Proposed Solution

PhantomGuard AI analyzes energy consumption patterns alongside occupancy and operational schedules to:

- Detect abnormal energy usage
- Identify phantom loads and inefficiencies
- Estimate cost and carbon impact
- Provide actionable optimization recommendations

The system shifts institutions from passive monitoring to proactive energy intelligence.
